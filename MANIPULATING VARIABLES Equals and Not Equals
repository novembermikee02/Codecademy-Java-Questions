1.
You have unearthed two unlabeled albums, record A and record B.To see if these are the same album, youâ€™re going to compare the number of songs on each one, and the total length of the albums.
First, create a variable called sameNumberOfSongs that stores whether the two albums have the same number of songs.

2.
Now, create a variable called differentLength that stores the result of checking whether the two album lengths are not the same.

example.

public class EqualNotEqual {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int songsA = 9;
    int songsB = 9;
    int albumLengthA = 41;
    int albumLengthB = 53;
    
    boolean sameNumberOfSongs = songsA == songsB;
    System.out.println(sameNumberOfSongs);
    boolean differentLength = albumLengthA != albumLengthB;
    System.out.println(differentLength);
    
	}
}
