1.
You have been trying to complete a 30 day challenge to drink enough water per day.

Create a double variable called totalRecommendedAmount and set it to the product of the recommended water intake (recommendedWaterIntake) and the amount of days in the challenge (daysInChallenge).

2.
Create a boolean variable called isChallengeComplete and set it to the result of checking if your intake, yourWaterIntake, is at least as much as the totalRecommendedAmount.

Then, print the isChallengeComplete variable.


example.

public class GreaterThanEqualTo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double recommendedWaterIntake = 8;
      double daysInChallenge = 30;
      double yourWaterIntake = 235.5;
      double totalRecommendedAmount = recommendedWaterIntake * daysInChallenge ;
      boolean isChallengeComplet = yourWaterIntake >= totalRecommendedAmount;
      System.out.println(totalRecommendedAmount);
      System.out.println(isChallengeComplet);
    }       
}
