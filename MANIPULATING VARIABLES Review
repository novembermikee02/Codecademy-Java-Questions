1.
To review, let’s try building some of the bank account functionality we talked about throughout the lesson.

First, create a new double variable called updatedBalance, and store balance with amountToWithdraw subtracted from it.

2.
Now, you’ve decided to split your balance evenly 3 ways and give it to your three best friends.

Create a double variable called amountForEachFriend that holds your updated balance divided by 3.

3.
Your friends each want to buy a concert ticket with the money you’ve given them. The tickets cost 250!

Create a boolean called canPurchaseTicket and set it equal to whether or not amountForEachFriend is at least enough to purchase a concert ticket.

Then, use System.out.println() to print canPurchaseTicket.

4.
How much money did you give your friends, anyway?

Use + and System.out.println() to print out:

I gave each friend <amountForEachFriend>...
with the value of amountForEachFriend where <amountForEachFriend> is.

Example.

public class BankAccount {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double balance = 1000.75;
      double amountToWithdraw = 250;
      double updatedBalance = balance-amountToWithdraw;
    System.out.println(updatedBalance);
      double amountForEachFriend = updatedBalance/3;
      System.out.println(amountForEachFriend);
      boolean canPurchaseTicket = amountForEachFriend==amountForEachFriend;
      System.out.println(canPurchaseTicket);
      System.out.println("I gave each friend " + amountForEachFriend+"...");
    }       
}

o/p
750.75
250.25
true
I gave each friend 250.25...
