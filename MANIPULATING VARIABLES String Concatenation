1.
In our zoo, we have a certain number of animals, stored in animals, of a certain species, stored in species.

Use + to make a new String variable called zooDescription. It should hold a String that looks like:

Our zoo has <animals> <species>s!
For example, if we had 5 animals that were all of the species Masai Giraffe, the String would say:

Our zoo has 5 Masai Giraffes!

2.
Print out the variable zooDescription!

Example.

public class Zoo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      int animals = 12;
      String species = "zebra";
      String zooDescription = "Our zoo has " + animals + " " + species+"s!";
      System.out.println(zooDescription);
      
    }       
}

o/p
Our zoo has 12 zebras!
